## Introduction

The Bored API project is designed to provide users with spontaneous activity ideas when theyâ€™re looking for something to do. This program:
- Retrieves activity suggestions from the Bored API.
- Displays the suggested activity along with its category.
- Allows users to request additional activities interactively.
- Provides a simple and engaging experience for those seeking entertainment or inspiration.

## Features

- Instant Activity Suggestions: Generates new activities with a simple API call.
- Interactive Experience: Users can request multiple suggestions until they find something interesting.
- Categorized Activities: Each activity comes with a type (e.g., recreation, education, social).
- Error Handling: Detects failed API requests and displays appropriate messages.

## How It Works
1. Fetching Activity Data â€“ The script sends a request to the **Bored API** and retrieves a random activity.
2. Parsing the API Response â€“ The returned JSON data is processed and displayed.
3. User Interaction â€“ Users can request a new activity or exit the program.
4. Main Functionality â€“ The script runs in a loop until the user decides to stop.

## Usage Instructions
1. Install dependencies (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install requests

## Future Improvements
- Add activity filtering: Allow users to specify activity types (e.g., "I want a social activity").
- Implement multiple API calls: Retrieve and display multiple suggestions at once.
- Integrate with other APIs: Connect with a scheduling or weather API for context-aware suggestions.
- Build a GUI or web app: Make the experience more visual and interactive with a Streamlit or Flask interface.
